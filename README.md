<h3 id="proposed-architecture">Proposed Architecture</h3>
<p>Backend with Flask - App has minimal routing, and preformance is held on single plage (meaning my feed page), so use and scabality wonâ€™t be an issue.</p>
<p>Authentication - using oAuth (in Python).</p>
<p>Frontend with HTML/CSS/Boostrap4 - No new technologies being use. MVP is going to be a clean, introductory site with full functionality of Spotify API. Further design will be implemented based on feedback from UX designer.</p>
<p>Spotify API (Python Interface) - Second new technology allowing me to integrate Spotify playlists into my app.</p>
<h3 id="mvp-working-list-for-in-class">MVP (working list for in class):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Have a full CRUD app for a user to login, authenticate, and create accounts</li>
<li>Be able to post and share playlists (any other feature or related voting, etc.) will be post MVP. enter link description here</li>
</ul>
